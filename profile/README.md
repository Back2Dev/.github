## Born out of a bootcamp exercise made for a not for profit bycicle workshop
<br>

It started with a simple app to record attendance for the mechanics. As the tech evolved so did our enthusiasm. Throw in a pandemic, multiple lockdowns, and a lot of time at home, and Back to Dev was born.
<br>

Our focus:

- Cutting edge web stacks
- Modular applications
- Test driven development
- Custom made code

## We want to
<br>

Help people get into the tech industry by providing challenges, mentorship, and guidance.

Most of what we do is online, but we are based in Melbourne, Australia :australia:
